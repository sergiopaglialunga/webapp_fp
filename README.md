# Final Project

## Explanation of the app

The application is a Fantasy Football app 

The users have to sign un with a username and password

When the users sign in, they can pick a football team 
choosing players from a list of options.

When the users sign in again they will be able to see the 
football team that they saved the last time.

The users will be able to pick a different team that would replace
the previous one.

## Database

The database has 3 tables:

1. Users: storing user name, password and user id

2. Teams: storing the team id, team name, players, and 
the user id that will link the Users table.

3. ID: it will store temporary data that I need to access in different parts
of the app, like user id and user name.
